# Yet Another Dungeon Crawler
You wake up in what seems to be a dungeon, the stone brick walls cracking and covered in vines.
The ground is damp and dirty, and beside a dark doorway lies a torch, shield, and knife.
From the doorway you can hear faint noises, which you cannot identify as friendly or not.
You pick up the wooden shield and rusty blade, along with the torch and stare down the hallway.
Tools and weapons in hand, you take a deep breath and walk into the darkness.

What awaits this dungeon's dark halls?
Will you survive to see the end?
